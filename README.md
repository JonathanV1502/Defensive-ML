# Defensive-ML-

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are designed to monitor network or system activities for malicious actions and policy violations ensuring the security of a network. Machine learning enhances the capabilities of intrusion detection by enabling the system to learn from data without explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of network traffic data to detect patterns and anomalies that may indicate a security breach. These algorithms adapt over time, improving their accuracy in identifying new and evolving threats. This adaptability provides a dynamic defense mechanism that can keep pace with concurrent cyber threats.
